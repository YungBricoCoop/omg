# üåê Services

OMG uses [Google Safe Browsing API](https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4) to detect malicious links. It also uses [OpenAI's Chat Completion API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/completions-api) with the gpt-3.5-turbo model to assign an oddness value (ranging from 0 to 100) to the email body and subject. To ensure data protection, all potential links and emails are replaced with placeholders, to avoid data leakage (since OpenAi store everything).
